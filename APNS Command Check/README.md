# APNS Command Check
**Created: February 2019**

The APNS Command Check script will check your MySQL database for any failed APNS Commands and clear them if found. 

### Notes
  - This script was originally written for use with multiple databases, however it will also work for single databases. See the script comments for more details.
  - If your MySQL database is located on the computer that will be running this script, be sure to remove the -h option from all three mysql commands. See the script comments for more details.
