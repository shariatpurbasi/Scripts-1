# Remote Connection Project
This repo contains a script that will help simplify the process of estabishing a remote connection.

## Version 1.0 (March 2018)
The script contains the following tools and utilities:
- SSH
- VNC
- Host Lookup

**Notes and Features**
 - Sometimes, when attempting to establish a VNC (Screen Sharing) connection, you may see a prompt stating that VNC (Screen Sharing) is not enabled and must be enabled before you are allowed to connect. If you are able to ssh into the remote computer, you are automatically given the option to copy the command to enable VNC (Screen Sharing) to your clipboard, which will allow you to enable VNC (Screen Sharing) if needed to.
